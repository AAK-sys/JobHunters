### Problem Statement

-   Nowadays, submitting the same resume to multiple job postings isn't enough to land an interview.
-   We need to be able to cater our resume to what the job requests for (requirements, work experience, skills).
-   There is no easy way to change your resume so that it fits a companyâ€™s job post description.
-   To do so, we will need to change our resume directly and save it as another file for every job application (This is time and energy consuming).

### Technical Solution

-   Create an application that allows users to build a resume with information of their choice.
-   Users input all possible information that they think they will need to build a resume.
-   Build a resume with users selecting which information to use among their pool of inserted information.
-   Allow users to download that newly built resume as a pdf.
